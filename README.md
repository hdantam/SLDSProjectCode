# SLDSProjectCode
Code for our statisical analysis project

This project was mainly concerned with investigating and predicting resale prices based on a dataset from the open database provided by the Singapore government. With this initial dataset, we added GIS values and saw how well the values could predict resale price when trained on past years and predicted year 2025. 

## The folders are divided into 3 sections:
### 1. Data_reading_and_creation
This was code needed to read in and get the coordinate data for the various datasets (MRT, Bus, HDB)

### 2. Datasets
A comprehensive folder of all the datasets involved in our project, with a key folder showing which we used for our final modelling and testing


### 3. Data_analysis_modelling
This is the code involved in our exploratory analysis and modelling
